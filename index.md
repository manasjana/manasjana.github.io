I'm currently a first year PhD student, part of the [IIT Kharagpur Math-Crypto Group](https://www.kgpmathcrypto.com/) at [IIT Kharagpur,India](http://www.iitkgp.ac.in/). My Main area of research is post-quantum cryptography, more specifically [isogeny-based cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supersingular_isogeny_key_exchange). Also I'm interested in quantum safe [zero knowledge proofs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-knowledge_proof) and their applicatom in blockchain technolodgy. I'm working under [Prof. Sourav Mukhopadhay](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~sourav/) and [Prof. Ratna Dutta](http://www.facweb.iitkgp.ac.in/~ratna/). 





   Before starting my PhD, I'm doing MSc in Mathematics from [Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Educational and Research Institute](http://maths.rkmvu.ac.in/), specialising on [Algebraic Combinatorics.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_combinatorics)
